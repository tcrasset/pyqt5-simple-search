# pyqt5-simple-search
Simple program with GUI to search, add or remove a certain sequence from a file.

The binaries are in the folder [binaries/](binaries/).

You must have your text file `tables.txt` in the same directory as your binary to be able to run it.
This text file is a kind of database for the program and all the logic relies on it being there
with that exact same name.
